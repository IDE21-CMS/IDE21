# IDE21
Restarting CMS-IDE project from 2013, powered by Docker, which made the task of installing this software trivial. It needs a fat rewriting, since the technology used in it is ancient, Zend Framework 1... Though for use on local it could also serve as an experimental design tool which exports HTML...

# INTRO to former version
Videos on youtube that describe CMS-IDE ( pretty old, from 2013 )

# IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE
This project needs volunteers in the form of designers, frontend developers, backend php developers who are familiar with both Zend and Laravel frameworks, since Todo list will be populated with translating Zend functionality to Laravel in the backend. Also frontend part will be going in the mobile direction where the templates which user can create should be mobile friendly and responsive.
There is a lot to rewrite here, but it should not be impossible to create something new and exciting...

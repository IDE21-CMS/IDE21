# IDE21
Restarting CMS-IDE project from 2013, powered by Docker, which made the task of installing this software trivial. It needs a fat rewriting, since the technology used in it is ancient, Zend Framework 1... Though for use on local it could also serve as an experimental design tool which exports HTML...
#INTRO to former version

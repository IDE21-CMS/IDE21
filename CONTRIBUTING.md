# IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE

This project needs volunteers in the form of designers, frontend developers, backend php developers who are familiar with both Zend and Laravel frameworks, since Todo list will be populated with translating Zend functionality to Laravel in the backend. Also frontend part will be going in the mobile direction where the templates which user can create should be mobile friendly and responsive.
There is a lot to rewrite here, but it should not be impossible to create something new and exciting...
